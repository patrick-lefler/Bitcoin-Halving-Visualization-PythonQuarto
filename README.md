Bitcoin Halving Process VisualizationA quantitative analysis and visualization of Bitcoin's supply schedule, demonstrating the asymptotic approach to the 21 million supply cap through programmatic halvings.📌 Project OverviewThis project utilizes Python within a Quarto framework to model Bitcoin's monetary policy. By simulating the block reward reduction that occurs every 210,000 blocks, this notebook generates interactive visualizations of the geometric series that defines Bitcoin's scarcity1111.The analysis projects approximately 34 halving events, calculating supply metrics from the genesis block in 2009 through the theoretical depletion of block rewards in 21402222.📊 VisualizationsThe project generates four key outputs:Cumulative Supply Curve: A linear-scale visualization of the total Bitcoin supply over time, showing the asymptotic approach to the 21,000,000 cap3.Remaining Supply Decay: A log-scale analysis of the unmined Bitcoin remaining, highlighting the consistent exponential decay of available supply4.Block Reward Schedule: A bar chart tracking the reduction of block rewards from 50 BTC down to effectively zero5.Halving Data Table: A detailed tabular view of specific halving epochs, calculating the exact BTC mined per period and the percentage of the cap reached6.🛠️ Technical StackFramework: Quarto (v1.2+)Language: Python 3.xKey Libraries:pandas & numpy: Data generation and manipulation7.plotly: Interactive graphing (Log scales, hover templates)8.session_info: Environment reproducibility9.🧮 MethodologyThe core logic relies on a simulation function generate_halving_data() which iterates through 34 projected halving events10.The Mathematical ModelThe total supply is calculated as a geometric series11:$$\text{Total Supply} = \sum_{n=0}^{64} 210{,}000 \times \frac{50}{2^n}$$Parameters used:Initial Block Reward: 50 BTCHalving Interval: 210,000 blocks (~4 years)Termination Criteria: When block reward < 1 Satoshi ($10^{-8}$ BTC)12.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesEnsure you have Python installed along with the Quarto CLI.Install Python Dependencies:Bashpip install pandas numpy plotly session_info jupyter
